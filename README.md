# pqc-scan

[日本語](README.ja.md)

`pqc-scan` is a Rust command-line tool for investigating migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
It reads local project files, finds references to cryptographic algorithms and libraries, and reports the locations and suggested follow-up work.
Use it to decide what to investigate before changing JWT, TLS, PKI, SSH or other cryptographic components.

Scanning and report generation run entirely on your machine using local rules and parsers. No LLM or AI service is required: pqc-scan makes no outbound connections during these operations and does not send source code or scan results to external services. No AI-service API key or subscription is needed.

Downloading build/install dependencies, uploading reports through CI you configure, and opening external reference links are separate network activities. Once the tool and rules are available locally, scanning works offline.

## What can I scan?

Point the scanner at a local repository. It inspects the following artifacts within its supported patterns and formats:

| Artifact | Languages or file examples | What the scanner looks for |
|---|---|---|
| Source code | Java, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Python, Rust, Ruby | Cryptographic APIs, algorithm names and related usage patterns, with dedicated TypeScript and TSX grammars |
| Configuration files | Kubernetes/Ingress, nginx, Apache httpd, Envoy, Istio, HAProxy, Traefik | TLS/cipher/group settings and other cryptographic configuration signals |
| Public certificates | `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer`, `.der` | Signature and subject-key algorithms, supported key sizes/curves, validity periods and public fingerprints |
| Private-key markers | RSA, generic PKCS#8 and OpenSSH private-key headers | The presence of supported headers; no decryption or private-key validation |
| Dependency manifests and locks | `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `package.json`, npm/pnpm locks, Python/Ruby/Java/Go dependency files | Relevant libraries, declared version constraints and supported resolution records |
| Existing SBOM files | CycloneDX JSON and SPDX JSON | Reported dependency components/packages; not proof of installation |

PKCS#12 (`.p12`/`.pfx`) supports unencrypted public-certificate extraction. Encrypted contents and private-key bags remain unsupported; no password, decryption or integrity/trust verification is performed.
See [supported inputs and inspection limits](docs/user/COVERAGE.md) for the full file list, supported versions and parser boundaries.
Live endpoints are inspected only through separately enabled, explicit [TLS probes](docs/user/PROBING.md).
They are not repository scan targets. Arbitrary programming languages are not supported.

## What does it do?

- Locates cryptographic references and attaches severity, risk labels and source context.
- Provides migration guidance for the affected language or runtime.
- Writes HTML/Markdown for investigation and JSON/SARIF for automation.
- Lists cryptographic findings and software dependencies in separate inventory files.
- Optionally records richer observations, local advisory assessments and inspection diagnostics.

A reference to a PQC algorithm is useful evidence, but it does not establish that the application uses it successfully. The [report guide](docs/user/REPORTS.md#pqc-findings) explains these findings with examples.

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## Run your first scan

Use the Rust toolchain pinned in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) (currently Rust 1.93.1) and install from this checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/pqc-scan
cargo install --locked --path crates/pqc_scan_cli
```

Keep the checkout's `rules` directory available after installation. The binary does not bundle that directory; use an absolute `--rules-dir` path when scanning another project.
If the command is not found, check that `~/.cargo/bin` is in `PATH`.

```bash
pqc-scan scan /path/to/your-product --format all --out-dir /path/to/reports/product-scan --rules-dir /path/to/pqc-scan/rules
```

Use a new output directory outside the scanned repository when comparing scans, so old/generated reports do not become part of the input or get confused with current output.
To produce Japanese HTML/Markdown, add `--lang ja`. [Running from source](docs/user/SCANNING.md#from-source) is also supported.

<a id="results"></a>

## Read the results

Open `report.html` first. Review a finding's file location, source context and suggested checks before deciding on a change.
Search and filters help you work through repeated findings; `report.md` provides a portable text version.
Both show inspection status; selecting a local assessment also adds its advisory decisions.

`--format all` writes six files: `report.html`, `report.md`, `report.json`, `report.sarif`, `cbom.json` and `dependency-sbom.json`.
The last two list cryptographic findings and software dependencies respectively. Their purpose and relationship are explained in [choosing a report](docs/user/REPORTS.md#choose-report).
Additional inventory, assessment and diagnostic files require explicit options.
Use `--cyclonedx-17` for separate CycloneDX 1.7 exports, or `diff` to compare
inventories with the same explicit repository scope. See the [report guide](docs/user/REPORTS.md).

## User guides

| Guide | Use it when you need to… |
|---|---|
| [Scanning repositories](docs/user/SCANNING.md) | Select outputs, configure CI exit codes, inspect incomplete scans or run from source |
| [Understanding reports](docs/user/REPORTS.md) | Interpret risk/PQC findings, choose an inventory, understand CBOM/SBOM or use local policy assessment |
| [Supported inputs and inspection limits](docs/user/COVERAGE.md) | Check languages, file formats, certificate handling, rule packs, exclusions and privacy boundaries |
| [Explicit TLS diagnostics](docs/user/PROBING.md) | Inspect one authorized endpoint with the optional protocol command |


Each guide has a Japanese version linked at the top.

## Limits and privacy

This is static, advisory analysis. False positives and missed references are possible; a finding does not prove runtime use, and zero findings does not prove complete inspection or safety.
Repository scans do not contact endpoints, validate certificate trust chains, install dependencies or certify PQC migration completion.
Optional `probe` commands contact only the explicitly selected endpoint; TLS uses
ordinary certificate/name validation, while SSH collects unauthenticated offers.

Recognized private-key/credential syntax is masked, with deliberately conservative previews. This is not universal secret detection: unknown/obfuscated content and secrets placed in paths or identifiers can remain outside the policy.
Review the [privacy and scan-scope limits](docs/user/COVERAGE.md#privacy) before sharing reports.
